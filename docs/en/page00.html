        Ok, you're a programmer that is familiar with a higher-level programming language 
        (Java, c++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby etc), but doesn't have a good idea what 
        happens at the byte code level. This mini-book will give you, a high-level 
        programmer, a better idea of what happens when your code is compiled. 
        (Interpreting is another layer of abstraction)

    <h3>Um, I've never programmed before</h3>

        Not sure how you got to this page, but go watch the visual simulations 
        because they're pretty memorizing! Some of the demos do require a touch
        of knowledge of JavaScript, but the visualizations have a convenient play
        button so you can just sit back and watch.

    <h3>But wait, I know Assembly already!</h3>

        Welcome! Please check out the simulator, assembler and compiler code in our
        <a href="https://github.com/alexbrjo/Elite8">git repo</a>!
        If you see any inconsistencies in the information please feel free to start 
        a github issue or send a push request. This resource was created when I was
        starting to learn assembly and about microprocessors so there's probably
        some incorrect information in here. I am absolutely still a beginner and 
        am revising the information in this book as I learn.

        Whatever your background: thank you, and enjoy!
