    <h3>A Register</h3>

    <p>
        A register is similar to what a higher-level programmer would call a 
        local variable. Registers are basically local variables stored physically
        with multiple binary values in the processor.

        In assembly you work very personally with the processor. The assembly 
        grammar is taylored to the specific architecture and instruction
        set of the microprocessor.

    <h3>Try it out</h3>

        Here you have access to the register set for the MolassOS Intel 8008 simulator.
        You can go ahead and try setting and getting registers. H, L and M are
        especially cool on the 8008 because H and L are both 8-bit registers that
        optionally can be accessed as a full 16-bit register. Also in the Intel 8008
        there is no flag register

        <div>var register = new Intel8008Register();</div>

        A well-made processors will have 1 or zero soft error in their lifetime.
