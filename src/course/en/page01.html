    <h1>Storing Data</h1>
    <h4>with electricity!</h4>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <p>
        The goal of computer memory is to store an amount of data that can be 
        read from and written to. The issue with memory is that Software 
        Engineers always want to be able to store more data and to be able
        to access that data faster and faster. Computer Engineers are doing a great
        job developing faster and larger computer memory, giving us hardware that
        ranges from floppy disks to solid state memory.

    <h3>A bit by itself isn't very useful</h3>

        Even if you aren't a programmer you probably know that computers store 
        all their data in 0s and 1s, but you might not know just how computers
        use those binary values to represent non-binary things such as text
        and images.

        The <b>word size</b> is the length of the shortest unit of data that a 
        microprocessor will read. The word size for an 8-bit processor is 8 bits,
        the word size for a 16-bit processor is 16 bits, etc.

    <h3>Lets read/write from memory!</h3>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <p>
        Below is a console that you can use a few JavaScript commands in. You can
        try writing to and reading from the memory simulator from the Elite8
        simulator.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>memory.read( location ); // writes a value to a memory location</li>
        <li>memory.write( location , value );  // read a value from a memory location</li>
        <li>memory.peek( x ); // peeks ahead 1 or x number of memory locations</li>
        <li>memory.clear(); // clears the memory</li>
        <li>memory.size(); // returns the word-length of the memory </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why binary?</h3>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <p>
        But why is that?

    <h3>Word Size Example: the Magic OS number</h3>
    <div class="hr"></div>
    <p>    
        When you're starting your computer, after the microprocessor completes it's
        own routines, it begins reading from the BootLoader memory location. This 
        starts the operating system. In x86 assembly for 16-bit computers this 
        BootLooter block must end with a 'magic number' 0xAA55. In binary 
        this is the pattern: 1010101001010101. This pattern tells the processor
        that there is a valid operating system and it can move past BIOS. The 
        alternating patterns of 0s and 1s was thought to protect against corrupt 
        memory. The 0xAA55 'magic number' is a 16 bit value and an example of 
        the word size for a 16-bit processor.
